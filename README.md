# Project_AirShow
 
# Packages needed to run the program are *OS, SHUTIL, MOVIEPY -- 'pip install moviepy'

# Before running the program please provide the path for input file through 'filename' variable

# The program can be run using any IDE or through the following command 'python3 program.py'

# Under current working directory, the program writes the data to a 'output' directory; incase if any 'output' directory ALREADY exists THE PROGRAM WILL OVERWRITE THE DATA

# Note: This program implementation is only compatible with windows OS, due to difference in FS structure may need to update writing path in other OS.
